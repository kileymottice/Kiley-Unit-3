# Kiley-Unit-3
The repository contains 1 python notebook, and the original set of data, the notebook covers basic topics in coding with Python3, and beginner modules on using the Pandas package for data analysis. These materials have been adapted from the lessons done in class by Professor Gotzler.

WHAT IS IN THE DATA?

This data came from the CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv that has information on health from every state, county, and region. The condensed data provided in the notebook focuses on adult obesity, physical inactivity, and access to exercise opportunities in the states of KY, AZ, and CT. All show different information and data from three different areas of the country, the South, Northeast, and West.

WHY THIS DATA?

The purpose of this data is to provide information about health and obesity and the way where you live and the exercise opportunities can contribute to obesity and how active and healthy people are there. This data could be used to help provide new opportunities for people without them and allow people to notice what can contribute to obesity in the U.S. It was created to give attention to the problem of obesity and the reasons it may be greater in the U.S. than other countries. To see the correspondence between the data, these these  [visualization 1](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/11890409/) [visualization 2](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/11890298/) can show it.
